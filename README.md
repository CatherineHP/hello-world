# hello-world
This is the repository I am using in the GitHub tutorial.

I am Catherine and I am just learning version control for the first time.  I had to use other version controls in two of my classes, but since I always finished my work before other people started theirs, I never had to worry about merges, so I never really got to know how to use a version control application.
